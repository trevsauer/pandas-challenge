Here are the observale trends I have found from the data:
      1) The game is mostly played by males, who make up 84.03% of the players, with women making up 14.06%. This leaves the remaining 1.91%, which could stem from people too lazy to submit their gender, or who might still be confused about thier gender. I am  sure by playing this thrilling game, they will find the answer they seek. 
      2) The average purchase for women is higher however, but not by much (40 cents more). The amount of money spent by males are greater, due to the larger male population of players, but it seems that the women playing do happen to enjoy themselves in the markets of Pymoli. 
      3) The highest percentage of players are in the age groups of 20 to 24 (41.67%), with the next highest being the age groups of 15 to 19 years of age (25.64%). It seems that after the age of 24, interest in this game drops rapidly, with the age groups of 25-29 being 9.87% of players. It seems that the players of this game had a realization at the age of 25, that they probably should be moving on to greater things in life.
